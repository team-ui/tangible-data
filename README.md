Tangible Interaction Techniques for Multivariate Data Analysis

Instructions:
Tangibles can be used to represent one attribute of the data.

The attributes need to be assigned before you can begin using the fiducials.
The steps to assign are as follows
Note: in order for the system to enter the assign mode, only two fiducials must be present. a) Menu fiducial b) Unassigned fiducial (in the range 0-8)
1. Introduce the menu fiducial (currently, the one with id = 12). A menu will be displayed, with the attribute to be assigned highlighted in red. 
2. Now introduce any unassigned fiducial with id in the range 0-9. The fiducial gets assigned one attribute.
3. The entry of an already assigned menu gets removed, and the next attribute gets highlighted in the menu. 

Once the points are loaded on the screen, a special pointing fiducial (curently assigned to id = 31) can be used to know the name of each data point.
